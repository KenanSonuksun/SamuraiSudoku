# SamuraiSudoku
  The project has been done with c#. There is a samurai sudoku and the samurai sudoku includes 5  single sudoku. These 5 sudokus have common boxes. The code has a solving algorithm and the algorithm must work with thread. 
   
  Feature 1:   There is a text field in the project's folder. The text field includes values in samurai sudoku that are not blank boxes. The project's code gets these values from the text field and creates a samurai sudoku on the interface.
 
  Feature 2:   The code creates five threads. Every single thread works for just one sudoku. These threads start to work at the same time. After solving a chart appears. The chart is about the created threads' speed and count of solved boxes.
  
  Feature 3:    The code creates ten threads . Every single thread works for two sudokus. These threads start to work at the same time. After solving a chart appears. The chart is about the created threads's speed and count of solved boxes.
  
  About the features 2 and 3 : Users could compare threads' speeds and count of solved boxes with the charts and could find the fastest way to solve a samurai sudoku .
   
  Feature 4:   At the last step, the all filled values in samurai sudoku are saved in a text field like a database and the user can get these datas.
